# pre-commit-guardrails.sh — opt-in pre-commit hook for the Design-to-Code Bridge.
#
# When enabled in .claude/settings.json (or .git/hooks/pre-commit), this hook
# runs the same seven guardrail checks as the design-to-code-guardrails skill,
# but as a hard gate. The hook is silent on clean diffs.
#
# Severity is controlled by .design-to-code/config.yaml:
#   guardrail_severity: warn   # exits 0, prints warnings
#   guardrail_severity: error  # exits 1 on any violation
#
# To bypass for one commit: git commit --no-verify
# (We discourage --no-verify; investigate the violation first.)
#
# Install:
#   ln -sf "$PWD/.claude/plugins/design-to-code-bridge/hooks/pre-commit-guardrails.sh" .git/hooks/pre-commit
#   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
#
# Or via Claude Code settings:
#   {
#     "hooks": {
#       "preToolUse": [
#         { "tool": "Bash", "match": "^git commit", "command": "bash .claude/plugins/design-to-code-bridge/hooks/pre-commit-guardrails.sh" }
#       ]
#     }
